Things left to do:
  ☐ Ability to customize the header
  ☐ Sorting/Paging
  ☐ Ability to show/hide the header
  ☐ Ability to set the properties on a particular column (width of a cell when you don't have a header)
  ☐ Sorting when there is a query string already present (remove the two parameters you're using for sorting manually)
  ☐ Allow for sorting via jquery
  ✔ Template columns @done (13-05-08 07:40)
  ☐ ->addClasses for multiple at a time
  ☐ ->removeClass is not working
